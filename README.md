## 🧩 How to use the app

Once the app is open, here’s how to check an image:

1. **Select the Image**  
   Click the “Browse” or “Select Image” button to find the picture you want to test. The app supports common formats like JPG, PNG, and TIFF.

2. **Start the Detection**  
   Press the “Analyze” or “Check Image” button to begin. The software will review the image's metadata and run its machine learning checks.

3. **View the Result**  
   After a moment, the app will display whether it found signs that the image was AI-generated or likely real.

4. **Additional Info**  
   You can see details about the metadata that influenced the decision. This helps you understand why the software reached its conclusion.

## 🔍 What is metadata and why does it matter?

Metadata is hidden information stored inside image files. It includes details like:

- When and where the image was created
- The device used to take the photo
- Software used to edit the image
- Technical data about how the image was saved

AI-generated images often have missing or unusual metadata because software creates them differently than real cameras. Our app looks for these clues to tell what is real.

---

## ⚙️ Settings and Options

The app includes simple settings that let you adjust how deep the checks go:

- **Basic Scan:** Quick check of key metadata fields  
- **Full Scan:** More detailed analysis for better accuracy  
- **File History:** Optionally save past scan results for review  
- **Update Checks:** Enable automatic updates to keep detection methods current

You can access these from the settings menu in the app.

## 📂 Supported Image Types

The app works with most popular image types:

- JPEG / JPG (.jpg, .jpeg)  
- PNG (.png)  
- TIFF (.tif, .tiff)  
- BMP (.bmp)  

If your image type is not supported, convert it to one of these formats using any free image converter online.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems, try these steps:

- Make sure your system meets the requirements listed above  
- Download and install the latest version from the releases page  
- Restart the app and try again
